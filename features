v0.4
understands the concepts of Bases, Routes (a simple series of Bases), Teams and (Base) Reports.
can tell if a Team has been through a given Base, and hence if every Team on applicable Routes has gone through a given Base (ready to pack up), or if a given Team has been through every Base on its Route (i.e. completed) or even a simple timeline of a Team's movement.

v0.5
calculates the distance between two Bases, either direct or along the length of a given Route; gives the total length of a Route
can tell whether a Team has finished (arrived at final Base) or gone off Route (last known location not on Route) or give its last known location
gives a Team's statistics including walked distance, walking time, waiting at a Base time and average walking speed
All of the above bits and pieces culminate in the first actually useful function: determining the ETA of a Team at a given Base (next in route by default) by either using its average walking speed, or a set walking speed (for when a guaranteed underestimate is needed)

v0.6
easily configurable hike setups
distances between Bases can be set precisely
determines earliest and latest etas at a Base
can specify team start times
sorts (Base) Reports based on departure time
the Team's eta calculation is more configurable

v0.7
can define Base distances by route
uses a configurable wiggle factor to determine unknown distances
can automatically create Teams from minimal configuration
provides early warning of Team non-arrival
current hike configuration can be saved for future use
